# Real Estate Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 
This machine learning project is designed to give a comprehensive understanding of how real-world machine learning problems are tackled. The project is aimed at helping learners grasp the concepts of machine learning through a practical example involving a real estate company.

Project Overview
In this project, we address a problem faced by a real estate company that wants to predict house prices based on various features. The project is structured to walk you through the entire machine learning process.

Key Features
Problem Understanding: We begin by analyzing the problem from the perspective of the real estate company, understanding the requirements and the data needed.

Data Collection & Importing: We collect the necessary data and import it into a Jupyter notebook for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project includes steps to analyze the data, identify promising attributes, and understand correlations between different features.

Data Visualization: Various graphs and plots are created to visualize the data and uncover trends that can help in model building.

Data Preprocessing: We handle missing values, create a pipeline for data transformation, and prepare the data for modeling.

Model Building: Concepts like cross-validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, and sampling are applied to build a robust machine learning model.

Prediction: The final model is used to predict house prices based on the given features.

Interactive & Engaging: The video tutorial includes animations and cartoon characters to make learning interactive and engaging.
